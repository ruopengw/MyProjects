Here is my course project of the object-oriented programming.
We are asked to develop an email management system.

As the team leader, I led 4 people to develop this software to realize the following functions:
•  User Registration: Could log in or register new user. Data was stored in SQLite database.
• Sending & Receiving: Could send and receive emails with attachments to every third
party’s email address via POP3/SMTP protocols. Wrote socket in C to realize TCP/IP
protocol. The emails’ contents were encoded by base64 and encrypted by SSL.
• Spam Identification: Could identify spams via naive Bayesian classifier automatically.
The classifier was trained with a dataset of spams in python.
• UI/UX: We used the framework of Qt graphical user interface based on C++.
