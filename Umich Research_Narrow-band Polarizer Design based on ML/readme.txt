Here is my summer research project with Prof. Jay Guo from University of Michigan.

Narrow-band Polarizer Design via Machine Learning
• Designed a narrow-band polarizer using Bayesian optimization to optimize its structural parameters because we were not sure how exactly these parameters determine its performance. In order to increase the weight of the working band, we adapted the density of sampling points in the search area we set.
• Developed a simulation of the novel polarizer using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) in MATLAB, achieved expected performance comparing with original goal.
